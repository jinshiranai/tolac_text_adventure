#STORY                                                                      #
#   You are a kobold, and you are very, very cross with your king.          #
#                                                                           #
#   The neighboring kingdoms of Lux and Cor have always had an...           #
# interesting relationship. Once a generation, the King of Lux and the King #
# of Cor meet to discuss the futures of their kingdoms. And then battle to  #
# the death. The winner of the post-summit duel to the death has their      #
# desires as expressed in the meeting met, and the survivors of the fallen  #
# king must meet them to the best of their kindgom's ability.               #
#                                                                           #
#   During the last cycle, the Dragons, your progenitors and the very       #
# reason you exist, expressed a desire to shed their Coran citizenship for  #
# Luxan. All well and good, you thought. You had no particular problems     #
# with Cor, it was your home, after all. But as long as the Dragons were    #
# happy, so were you. But after the destined battle, everything changed.    #
# Suddenly, kobolds were no longer treated as the noble servants of dragons #
# that they were born and bred to be. Suddenly, kobolds were a stain on     #
# the Coran name. You turned to your Dragon for explanation, only to find   #
# that this was the desire of the new King of Cor. The Dragons were welcome #
# to move to Lux, but they were to be seperated from their own creation,    #
# the kobolds. And the kobolds were to be treated as though they were no    #
# better than petty theives in the night.                                   #
#                                                                           #
#   This is what your king, the new King of Cor, decreed in the wake of the #
# Luxan/Coran summit. Your king not only failed you, but separated you from #
# your reason to exist. It was no surprise that you and many of your kind   #
# ended up becoming the very things you were made out to be in the public   #
# eye without your Dragons. But no matter how bad things got or how much    #
# things changed, you were certain of one thing:                            #
#                                                                           #
# If you ever saw the King of Cor, you would take your revenge.             #
